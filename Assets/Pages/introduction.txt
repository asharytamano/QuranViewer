The Maranao Qur’an Viewer is a desktop application designed to make the Holy Qur’an
accessible to Maranao-speaking Muslims through accurate translation and Tafsir,
while preserving the integrity of the original Arabic text.

This application traces its roots to an early Qur’an Viewer developed in 2002 by
the late Jamal Al-Nasir (London), which supported multiple Qur’an translations,
including Maranao. That pioneering work marked the first known digital Qur’an
application to include the Maranao language.

This Version 3.0 is a modern continuation of that legacy.

It presents the Qur’an in a clear, structured format:
• Arabic text rendered with proper right-to-left alignment
• Maranao translation placed directly beneath each verse
• Tafsir displayed on demand, verse by verse, to support deeper understanding

The Qur’an Viewer is designed for:
• Personal reading and reflection
• Study circles and teaching
• Preservation of the Maranao language in Islamic scholarship

Great care has been taken to ensure clarity, readability, and respect for the
Sacred Text. No interpretation replaces the Qur’an itself; Tafsir is provided
only as guidance, explanation, and contextual understanding.

This software is offered as a service to the Ummah, with the hope that it will
contribute to learning, reflection, and transmission of knowledge to future
generations — especially among Maranao Muslims.

May Allah accept this effort and make it beneficial.
